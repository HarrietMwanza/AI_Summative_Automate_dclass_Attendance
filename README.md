Our AI-powered project aims to automate attendance tracking by utilizing face recognition technology and Python programming language. The system scans the faces of individuals present in a room using either a pre-existing database or an assets folder and compares them with stored images. If a match is found, the system records the attendance by adding the name and timestamp to a CSV file.

The application is simple and can be customized as per the user's requirements. To run the application, simply click on "Run" on your VS Code or any other environment you are working on, and the camera will capture images and scan faces. To stop the application, press "Q".
